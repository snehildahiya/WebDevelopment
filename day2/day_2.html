    <h4 id="p1">Twinkle Twinkle Little Star</h4>
    <pre>Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
 How I wonder what you are!
 Up above the world so high,
 Like a diamond in the sky.

 When the blazing sun is gone,
 When he nothing shines upon,
 Then you show your little light,
 Twinkle, twinkle, through the night.

 Then the traveller in the dark
 Thanks you for your tiny spark;
 He could not see where to go,
 If you did not twinkle so.

 In the dark blue sky you keep,
 And often through my curtains peep,
 For you never shut your eye
 Till the sun is in the sky.

 As your bright and tiny spark
 Lights the traveller in the dark,
 Though I know not what you are,
 Twinkle, twinkle, little star.</pre>
    <h4 id="p2">Jack And Jill</h4>
    <pre>Jack and Jill went up the hill
 To fetch a pail of water
 Jack fell down and broke his crown,
 And Jill came tumbling after.
 
 Up Jack got, and home did trot
 As fast as he could caper;
 To old Dame Dob, who patched his nob
 With vinegar and brown paper.
 
 Up Jack got and home did trot,
 As fast as he could caper;
 And went to bed and bound his head
 With vinegar and brown paper.
 </pre>
    <h4 id="p3">I'm A Little Teapot</h4>
    <pre>I'm a little teapot short and stout.
 Here is my handle.
 Here is my spout.
 When I get all steamed up,
 Hear me shout!
 Just tip me over
 And pour me out

I'm a clever teapot, yes it's true.
 Here's an example of what I can do.
 I can turn my handle to a spout.
 Just tip me over and pour me out
</pre>
    <h4 id="p4">Rain Rain-Go Away</h4>
    <pre>Rain rain go away
    come again another day
    litlle tommy wants to play
    rain rain go away
    </pre>
    <h4 id="p5">Baa Baa Black Sheep</h4>
    <pre>Baa, baa, black sheep,
 Have you any wool?
 Yes, sir, yes, sir,
 Three bags full;
 One for the master,
 And one for the dame,
 And one for the little boy
 Who lives down the lane.</pre>
    <h4 id="p6">Humpty Dumpty</h4>
    <pre>Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall,
 Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.
 Four-score Men and Four-score more,
 Could not make Humpty Dumpty where he was before</pre>
    <h4 id="p7">Johny Johny! Yes Papa</h4>
    <pre>Johny, Johny!
 Yes, Papa
 Eating sugar?
 No, Papa
 Telling lies?
 No, Papa
 Open your mouth!
 Ha! Ha! Ha!</pre>
    <h4 id="p8">London Bridge Is Falling Down</h4>
    <pre>London Bridge is falling down, 
 Falling down, Falling down. 
 London Bridge is falling down, 
 My fair lady. 

 Take a key and lock her up, 
 Lock her up, Lock her up. 
 Take a key and lock her up, 
 My fair lady. 

 How will we build it up, 
 Build it up, Build it up? 
 How will we build it up, 
 My fair lady? 

 Build it up with silver and gold, 
 Silver and gold, Silver and gold. 
 Build it up with silver and gold, 
 My fair lady. 

 Gold and silver I have none, 
 I have none, I have none. 
 Gold and silver I have none, 
 My fair lady. 

 Build it up with needles and pins, 
 Needles and pins, Needles and pins. 
 Build it up with needles and pins, 
 My fair lady. 

 Pins and needles bend and break, 
 Bend and break, Bend and break. 
 Pins and needles bend and break, 
 My fair lady. 

 Build it up with wood and clay, 
 Wood and clay, Wood and clay. 
 Build it up with wood and clay, 
 My fair lady. 

 Wood and clay will wash away, 
 Wash away, Wash away. 
 Wood and clay will wash away, 
 My fair lady. 

 Build it up with stone so strong, 
 Stone so strong, Stone so strong. 
 Build it up with stone so strong, 
 My fair lady. 

 Stone so strong will last so long, 
 Last so long, Last so long. 
 Stone so strong will last so long, 
 My fair lady.
